      Goals
		</p>

		</p>

      Perscribed Action
		</p>
   		 <p>
      Currently, the suggested actions include boycotting the service. This means that when an instance crops up in which you are supposed to use this serivce, don't. Send an email to the teacher requesting you to use it explaining that you are not and why you are not. Then, ask for it to be graded anyway. If they refuse, then take it up the chain to the next higher authority and repeat. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
      Taking this position against this serivce is not unprecedented. As well, your argument against this service is not indefensable. There are many resources that can be used to show and support your points.
   	 	</p>
    		<p>
      Note: this is not the only action you can take. You, student, can do as you wish in opposition to this, but keep in mind the this is not endorsed, and any consquences of these actions have not been taken into account. Proceed at your own risk.

      Specific Arguments
    		</p>
   		 <p>
      One of the biggest issues with TurnItIn.com is that it creates of presumption of guilt of the student. A presumption of guilt is when a suspect is assumed to be guilty, and must prove themselves innocent. TurnItIn.com creates a presumption of guilt because it sets and implements the expectation that students must prove themselves innocent of plagiarism to the school.
    		</p>
    		<p>
      The US Constitution specifies that in the US, a presumption of innocence is the law, not a presumption of guilt. This means that a presumption of guilt is implicitly illegal and unconstitutional. In addition, the United Nation's "Universal Decclaration of Human Rights", a globally binding convention on human rights, clearly states that a presumption of innocence is a human right. This means that a presumption of guilt is also a violation of human rights.
		</p>
		<p>
      The other main issue with TurnItIn.com is it has the ability to violate student's privacy. TurnItIn.com is subject to the US PATRIOT Act, a bill signed into law in 2001 in the aftermath of 9/11, the PATRIOT Act allows the US government access to company's databases without subpeonas from courts, and to issue gag ordersduring these searches to prevent those being searched from sharing that they had been searched. As TurnItIn.com is a company, this law is applicable to their databases. Their databases include the database that is full of student's writings, and the databases full of the student's information. This means that all of the student's information is effectively openly available for the peruesal of the US government, which clearly is a violation of student privacy.
		</p>
		<p>
      This also ties in with the other point that TurnItIn.com is a private company owned by the the descendents of S. I. Newhouse. This means that this family has the same data collection and peruesal as the Federal Government, over a collection of the nation's up and coming writers.

      Final Note
		</p>
		<p>
      The use of Turnitin.com is a serious issue in our school, and our district. We, as the new coming members of our society, need to take any action possible to bring the world we're coming into better. In particular, we need to be willing to fix the issues that others will not. We all need, today, to begin our grassroots change movement. And, of all the issues out there, this is as good a place as any to start.
